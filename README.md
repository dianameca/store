# demo

<!--
## Prerequisites

- ruby 
- rails 
- angular 
- npm

## Run in development mode

**Backend** 

    # start the rails server
    cd API 
    bundle update
    rails server

The API is at [`http://localhost:3000/products`](http://localhost:3000/products)

**Frontend**

    cd frontend
    npm install
    ng serve

The frontend is at [`http://localhost:4200`](http://localhost:4200)

## Deployment

Images are stored using Google Cloud. 

## REST API Resources

## Authentication and Identity Management

## Error handling and tests

### API

## What's missing 

- API versioning
- CI/CD pipeline
- move from Rest to GraphQL
